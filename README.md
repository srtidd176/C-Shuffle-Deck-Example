# C++-Shuffle-Deck-Example
Example C++ code for a deck shuffling problem

The class Deck is made of Card objects. The main function shuffles the deck and draws out
all the cards from the pile. The card value and suit is printed to the console to show
that the deck was properly shuffled.

This can be triggered by executing the Main.cpp file
